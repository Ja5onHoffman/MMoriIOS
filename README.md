(Unfinished)

This Memento Mori app takes your birth date, sex, country and your own conjectured life expectancy, then offers your
expected lifespan, calculated using the [World Population Project](http://www.population.io) API. A visualization is created using your lifespan input that depicts your life as a series of squares, each representing one week. Red squares are weeks lived, and blue squares are weeks remaining.
